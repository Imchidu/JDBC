1 ABSTRACTION----
      
	   The process of hiding implimentation and showing the 
	   functionality of an object using abstract class and interface 
	   is called Abstraction.
	   
	   ex-ATM machine.
	   
	   Abstraction can be achieved in two ways--
	   
	   *By abstract class using abstract keyword.
	   *By using interface.
	   
	   
 ENCAPSULATION----
 
       The process of wrapping or binding the sub code or data of object
	   is called Encapsulation.
	   
	   ex-jav+
	   
	   +9
	   a Bean,capsules.
	   
	   *private access modifier used during encapsulation.
	   
	   Access modifiers are-
	   *public
	   *private
	   *protected
	   *default
	   
	   
2   Is-relationship---
	     *Is-relationship is nothing but the inheriting the one class to another class.
		 * Is-relationship is done in inheritance of oops concept.
		 *In the Is-relationship process superclass properties inherits to subclass.
		 
	Has-A relationship----
	    *whenever a instance of one class used in other class is called the 
		HAS-A relationship. 



3   *Java doesnot support multiple inheritance because,
     It can lead to Diamond problem.
	 
	 
8   We can create constants in java  by using  the 'ENUM '.
    * In ENUM we store constants and we use them using ENUM.
	
	
7   *equality operator (==)-- this  checks both object pointing same  memory locations.
     
	 *Equals()-- used to comparison between two objects.
	 
	 
9   public = public access modifier which is used access any where
    private = private access modifier cannot be accessed in another class and can be used same package.
	protected=Protected access modifier also cannot accessed in another class and cannot be used in same pakage.
	
	
	
14  MARKER INTERFACE---
    Marker interface is a interface that doesnot have any methods and constant in it.

15  FINAL KEYWORD--
    *This is the keyword used for variable,method and class,if we sure about to not change or update in future.  
     
	STATIC KEYWORD--
	*It is a keyword used to declare the variables,methods.
	*If we used static keyword we only use as one copy.
	
10  WRAPPER CLASSES---
    *The wrapper classes in java are used for the methods that support objects like a conversion from other types.
	*Wrapper classes are uesful in synchromization in multi threading.
	
12 HEAP MEMORY--
   * Heap memory used by all the parts of application.
   
   STACK MEMORY--
   *Stack memory used only by one thread excecution.
